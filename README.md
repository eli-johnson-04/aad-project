# Programming Project - COP4533: Algorithms Abstraction and Design

## Scope
This project tackles the problem of ordering paintings at an art exhibition, with each painting of a specific height and width. Rows have a fixed width, and their height is determined by the tallest painting in a given row. The goal is to minimize the total height of the rows when stacked vertically upon each other, and various algorithmic paradigms are employed to solve this problem. 

## Milestone 1 - [Report](https://github.com/eli-johnson-04/aad-project/blob/main/Milestone_1/Milestone1_Report.pdf)
We designed, implemented, and proved the correctness and time complexity of two $\theta(n)$ greedy algorithms for different versions of the painting-platform problem. We also answered two questions related to applications of Algorithm 1 and tested the performance of our algorithms using Python's CSV library.
