## Problem S2
Given the heights *h~1~, ..., h~n~*, where there exists a *k* such that for all *i $\lt$ j $\le$ k*, *h~i~ $\ge$ h~j~*, and for all *k $\le$ i $\lt$ j*, *h~i~ $\le$ h~j~*, and the base widths *w~1~, ..., w~n~* of *n* paintings, along with the width *W* of the display platform, find an arrangement of the paintings on platforms that minimizes the total height.\
*(Note: The heights of the paintings follow a unimodal function with a single local minimum, as in EXAMPLE 3.)* 

### Example 3
*n* = 7, *W* = 10\
*h~i~* = [12, 10, 9, 7, 8, 10, 11]\
*w~i~* = [3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3]

### Solution 3
*Platform~1~* = [*s~1~...s~3~*]\
*Platform~2~* = [*s~4~*]\
*Platform~3~* = [*s~5~...s~7~*]\
*cost* = 12 + 7 + 11 = 30
